                <p class="modern">Wherever there are knock-off martial arts games or TV shows, there will always be the Nian. After all, cultural appropriation is totally okay so long as you keep it factual, right? Right?! With that said, here are a few modern-day references to our leonine leviathan: A Chinese animated comedy film called Mr. Nian (年兽大作战) follows the story of a hapless and bumbling Nian. There is a two-headed canine beast in the online game World of Warcraft called a Nian. During an annual event called The Lunar Festival, a boss version of this monster appears called Omen. In the online role-playing game Guild Wars, the Nian is part of an event called the Canthan New Year Celebration. There is a monster in the mobile strategy game Game of War called the Nian Lion whose appearance is clearly based on the Nian. Nian or “The Year Beast” features as an event boss as part of the New Bloom Festival in the online video game DOTA 2.In the video game World of Kung-Fu, the Nian features as a mount. In the online game Perfect World: International, there are creatures known as Nienbeasts that are available as mounts and were visually based on the Nian. The Nian makes an appearance in an episode of the animated sitcom Three Delivery entitled “Night of the Nian”. There is a television series called Spirit Warriors which feature Nian as characters, although they are portrayed as humanoid rather than bestial. In 2013, McDonald’s launched this amazing advert where a man refuses to give his hamburger to the Nian.</p>
